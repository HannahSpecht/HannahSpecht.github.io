  <h1> Legal Disclaimer </h1>
  <h3> Liability for Contents </h3>
  <p>
    The contents of my pages have been compiled with the greatest care. However, I cannot guarantee for accuracy, completeness or topicality of the contents.
    Legal obligations to removing information or to blocking the use of information remain unchallenged. In this case, liability is only possible at the time of knowledge about a specific violation of law. Illegal contents will be removed immediately at the time I get knowledge of them.
  </p>
  <h3> Liability for Links </h3>
  <p>
    My offer includes links to external third party websites. I have no influence on the contents of those websites, therefore I cannot guarantee for those contents. Providers or administrators of linked websites are always responsible for their own contents.
    The linked websites had been checked for possible violations of law at the time of the establishment of the link. Illegal contents were not detected at the time of the linking. A permanent monitoring of the contents of linked websites cannot be imposed without reasonable indications that there has been a violation of law. Illegal links will be removed immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.
  </p>
  <h3> Copyright </h3>
  <p>
    Contents and compilations published on these websites by the providers are subject to German copyright laws. Reproduction, editing, distribution as well as the use of any kind outside the scope of the copyright law require a written permission of the author or originator. Downloads and copies of these websites are permitted for private use only.
    The commercial use of our contents without permission of the originator is prohibited.
    Copyright laws of third parties are respected as long as the contents on these websites do not originate from the provider. Contributions of third parties on this site are indicated as such. However, if you notice any violations of copyright law, please inform me. Such contents will be removed immediately.
  </p>
  <h3> Data Protection </h3>
  <p>
    The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal data. Personal data, such as names, addresses or e-mail addresses, are always provided on a voluntary basis if possible. Those data will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit permission.
    However, I would like to point out that data transmissions via internet (e.g. e-mail communication) cannot be entirely secure and may have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of personal details against unauthorised access by third parties is not possible.
    Providers are obligated to publish contact information in the Legal Note/Impressum. The use of such contact information by third parties for the purpose of distributing unsolicited advertisements or other commercial information is prohibited.
    The operators of this website reserve the right to take legal measures in case of being sent unsolicited commercial information, e.g. spam mails etc.
